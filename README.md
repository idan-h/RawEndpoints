# RawEndpoints

RawEndpoints is a simple library for REST API development using .NET's Minimal API, adhering to the REPR (Request-Endpoint-Response) approach. It leverages source generators to simplify endpoint creation, reducing boilerplate code and providing a clean, non-opinionated solution.

## Design & Approach

- **Minimal API-Based**: Directly utilizes .NET's Minimal API, not a wrapper around it.
- **Source Generators**: Automatically generates minimal api boilerplate code.
- **Focused and Clean**: Aims to be minimalistic and stable.
- **Non-Opinionated**: Use it raw, partly, or fully. You decide.

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Examples**: Provide example projects.
- [ ] **Validation**: Integrate validations within the source generator.
- [ ] **Request Response OpenApi**: Enable automatic OpenAPI with request and response types.
- [ ] **Result OpenApi**: Analyze potenrial results and add them to OpenAPI specifications.
- [ ] **VS Templates**: Provide Visual Studio templates for new endpoints.
- [ ] **Benchmarks**: Add performance benchmarks.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are appreciated :)  
Keep in mind that the library will always stay simple and non-opinionated.
